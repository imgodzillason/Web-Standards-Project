		<h2>Call to Action</h2>
		<img src="images/CTA.jpg">
		<p>
			<strong>Target Audience:</strong> This call-to-action was designed to entice users to purchase food items listed
				within the website. Typical users will probably be women aged 25+ that are looking to purchase food
			items for various meals.
			<br/><br/>
			<strong>Client/User Needs:</strong> The use of the shopping cart provides a well-recognized icon that
			symbolizes the
			ability to purchase an item or items. While the site's end goal might be to have users purchase items, there is little description as to what the user can expect when clicking the icon. I would recommend a description for the user so they are aware of what to expect when clicking and that they enter the area most suited to their needs.
			<br/><br/>
			<strong>Critique:</strong> The call-to-action area surrounding the button provides an enticing image of food for the
			user to experience. The use of a white serif font over the images gives the impression that the user is
			going to be given an opportunity to create art with the food.  The icon's use of orange is representative of creativity, affordability, and most importantly food. Leveraging the use of this color will continue this mindset.

		<h2>Blog</h2>
		<img src="images/blog.jpg">
		<p>
			<strong>Target Audience:</strong> This blog's target audience would consist of males, ages ranging between 25 and 50
			with
			disposable income, who either own a car or who are looking for a website with reliable information
			regarding vehicles.
			<br/><br/>
			<strong>Client/User Needs:</strong> There is no option to make a purchase of a vehicle and thereby leads
			the viewer to
			assume this website is for informational purposes. Providing both a list of the latest posts and most
			popular posts gives the user options as to what to view. It does not appear that the site provides a way
			for users to search for specific makes or models though. I would propose providing the user the ability
			to search for the vehicle they wish to inspect, as well as providing the user with the opportunity to
			locate dealerships nearby that sell the vehicle that holds their interest.
			<br/><br/>
			<strong>Critique:</strong> The blog provides an excellent mix of image and description, as well as a prominent
			call-to-action urging the user to read more about the vehicle. The use of large images also allows the
			user to quickly determine if this is the vehicle they are searching for or if they should continue
			searching. The use of icons underneath the CTA also allows the user to see how engaged other users are
			regarding the vehicle. The use of orange and black with the CTAs also provides the right type of
			emotions, representing elegance, power, and stimulation.

		<h2>Contact</h2>
		<img src="images/Contact.png">
		<p>
			<strong>Target Audience:</strong> Target audience for this contact section is likely to consist of professionals
						 between
			the ages of 30 and 50 who are looking for a quick way to get in contact with the company.
			<br/><br/>
			<strong>Client/User Needs:</strong> The contact list provides three distinct methods of contact and urges
			the user to
			"get
			in touch" with the use of bold, black lettering. I would recommend providing the user with a means to
			click on the email links that would open up in their mailbox rather than force them to copy and paste
			after locating their email program. In addition, when accessed via mobile device, I would provide a means
			to click the phone that would allow the user to call the company rather than, again, copying and pasting
			the number.
			<br/><br/>
			<strong>Critique:</strong> The site provides a clear means in which to contact the company and uses familiar
				icons as a
			way to quickly identify the particular methods. The use of blues and white conveys professionalism and
			simplicity, both feelings you want your user to experience when searching for a way to contact your
			business.

		<h2>Navigation</h2>
		<img src="images/navigation.jpg">
		<p>
			<strong>Target Audience:</strong> The target audience of this navigation appears to be building developers
				looking for
			assistance with locating construction equipment.
			<br/><br/>
			<strong>Client/User Needs:</strong> The dropdown menu for the navigation provides a clear means of selecting the
			appropriate section. However, I would recommend also providing a hover box that provides the user with a
			brief description of each subsection to ensure the user selects the link they want.
			<br/><br/>
			<strong>Critique:</strong> The site's use of a honeycomb is a smart design choice, as bees are known to work hard
				and
			seemingly endless. The use of black and yellow, while also symbolic of the bee, gives a sense of energy
			and power.

		<h2>Footer</h2>
		<img src="images/Footer.png">
		<p>
			<strong>Target Audience:</strong> The target audience for this design would be tech-savvy and range in age from
				20 to 30.
			These are users who want to locate a section quickly without the hassle of scrolling.
			<br/><br/>
			<strong>Client/User Needs:</strong> The footer provides a quick means to obtain the content requested by the
				user. While
			it does this well, I would recommend removing the "Big News" portion and instead focus on the social
			network buttons for that portion of the screen. most likely, the user is not going to be interested in
			reading this section, as it appears more arduous to do so than the rest of the footer.
			<br/><br/>
			<strong>Critique:</strong> The strong contrast between the black background and lighter lettering provides a the
				user with
			a quick and easy means to read the text with little struggle. In addition, the social networking icons
			work well with the color scheme despite not being their "normal" colors.

		<h2>Newsletter</h2>
		<img src="images/newsletter.png">
		<p>
			<strong>Target Audience:</strong> Target audience for the newsletter section would be users aged 18 to 35 who are
			well-versed in the various methods businesses use to communicate with their users ie. social networking
			and RSS feeds.
			<br/><br/>
			<strong>Client/User Needs:</strong> While the sign-up provides multiple methods of communication, I don't see a
				clear
			means in which to sign up for the newsletter; only a means in which to unsubscribe. I recommend providing
			an entry form that allows the user to enter their email and subscribe to the newsletter. I would also
			recommend changing the link colors, as they blend in too much with the background.
			<br/><br/>
			<strong>Critique:</strong> The use of green with the word fresh continues feelings of nature and reliability and
				plays
			well with the blue background promoting trust and loyalty. The prominent display of social networking
			buttons gives the user an alternate method of obtaining information from the company while also providing
			various options for the user to select.

		<h2>Login</h2>
		<img src="images/login.png">
		<p>
			<strong>Target Audience:</strong> The login panel is used to target those who already have login credentials to the
			website and need to sign in to obtain their personal information.
			<br/><br/>
			<strong>Client/User Needs:</strong> The login panel provides a clear way for the user to sign in to the website and
			provides a method for resetting the password if it was forgotten. However there is not a way for
			non-members to sign up for access. I would propose extending the height of the panel and providing a
			call-to-action button underneath that entices the user to sign up for an account.
			<br/><br/>
			<strong>Critique:</strong> The use of blue, black, gray, and white within the login panel provides an
			excellent
				sense of
			formality, professionalism, and traditionalism. All of these feelings are required when logging into a
			website because the user wants to know that their information is secure and needs to feel like they are
			protected. The login panel is straightforward and easy to read, making it less of a hassle for the user
			to navigate.

		<h2>About</h2>
		<img src="images/about.jpg">
		<p>
			<strong>Target Audience:</strong> The target audience for this design would be photographers or other similar
				artists
			between the ages of 21 to 35.
			<br/><br/>
			<strong>Client/User Needs:</strong> While the large image of the individual provides a clear portrait of the
				client and a
			description in the center, there is no call-to-action enticing the user to explore other areas of the
			site. I would propose including a CTA button or graphic that encourages the user to experience other
			sections of the website while providing a description of said sections.
			<br/><br/>
			<strong>Critique:</strong> The about section provides a clear look at the client and allows the user to assess
				whether
			they want to engage with the site. The description in the center also provides the user with a quick
			overview of the client.

		<h2>Header</h2>
		<img src="images/header.jpg">
		<p>
			<strong>Target Audience:</strong> With the selected header, we're looking at a target audience of business owners
				who are
			looking for stability in their business and their investments. Most likely, these will be owners who are
			concerned with their economic future due to the use of the words "strong," "stable," and "safe" in the
			center.
			<br/><br/>
			<strong>Client/User Needs:</strong> The header provides a strong call-to-action directly beneath the company's
				tag line
			and allows the user to immediately engage with the website. However, the logo used for the bank does not
			mesh well with the stability the company is trying to portray to its customers, both present and future.
			While a rocket might be considered strong, they are neither safe nor stable. I would recommend the client
			change their logo to something that gives the mindset of security, such as a vault or a lock.
			<br/><br/>
			<strong>Critique:</strong> As mentioned previously, the header has a strong call-to-action within it. However,
				the color
			used does not give a sense of security, as red gives the feeling of danger and boldness--something quite
			opposite of stability. I would suggest the use of a blue or green CTA, as they are more representative of
			what the company is looking to instill in its customers.

		<h2>Features</h2>
		<img src="images/features.jpg">
		<p>
			<strong>Target Audience:</strong> The features section provides a clean and easily readable description of the
				services
			provided. The target audience is most suitable for "on-the-go" people who have little time to read long
			explanations and want the "meat and potatoes" of what's being offered.
			<br/><br/>
			<strong>Client/User Needs:</strong> While the style is clean and provides a significant cutoff point for each
				section, I
			believe the text to be small and act as a hindrance to the site's readability. I would recommend
			increasing the size of the icons and keeping, at most, three icons per line to adjust the font size as
			needed.
			<br/><br/>
			<strong>Critique:</strong> The use of blue icons is an excellent choice when providing a description of services
				rendered.
			It gives the implication of professionalism and reliability, both of which are needed when trying to win
			over a customer. The use of circular outlines around the icon meshes well with the use of blue, as it
			does not feel cut off with it being boxed, nor does it feel like it's floating around without an outline.
