				site will be used to house multiple design functions that I can recall as needed in the future. It

		<h2>Call to Action</h2>
		<img src="images/cta.jpg">
		<p>
			Target Audience: This call-to-action was designed to entice users to purchase food items listed
				within the website. Typical users will probably be women aged 25+ that are looking to purchase food
			items for various meals.
			<br/><br/>
			Client/User Needs: The use of the shopping cart provides a well-recognized icon that symbolizes the
			ability to purchase an item or items. While the site's end goal might be to have users purchase items, there is little description as to what the user can expect when clicking the icon. I would recommend a description for the user so they are aware of what to expect when clicking and that they enter the area most suited to their needs.
			<br/><br/>
			Critique: The call-to-action area surrounding the button provides an enticing image of food for the
			user to experience. The use of a white serif font over the images gives the impression that the user is
			going to be given an opportunity to create art with the food.  The icon's use of orange is representative of creativity, affordability, and most importantly food. Leveraging the use of this color will continue this mindset.
